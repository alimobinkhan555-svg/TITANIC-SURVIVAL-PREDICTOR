# Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using a Logistic Regression model. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 🧠 Methodology  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.  
- Performed feature engineering to improve model performance.  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize survival patterns based on age, gender, passenger class, and embarkation port.  
- Trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression classification model.

---

## 📊 Key Features  
- Predicts passenger survival (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)  
- Uses features such as age, gender, passenger class, and embarkation port  
- Includes visual insights into survival trends
